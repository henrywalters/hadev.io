      <a href="/">Hadev.io</a> was developed as a hub for my software engineering projects as well as a forum for technical discussion.
      The focus of the featured projects are primarily game, web and general tooling. Source code for all projects and utilities (including this site)
      can be found on my <a href="https://github.com/henrywalters">Github</a> account.

    <p class="secondary-font">My name is Henry Walters and I started my programming journey developing programs on my TI-84 when I should have
      been paying attention in math class. I moved on to pursue a degree in Mathematics.  Throughout my college career,
      I dabbled more and more in programming, developing projects on the side as well as tools to help in my studies.
      It eventually occurred to me that programming was my true passion, with a special focus on computationally difficult problems.

    <p class="secondary-font">I continue to work, full-time, as a software engineer at a IT company in Metro Detroit. I am in charge of
    working with clients across various business domains to update their pre-existing software in addition to building custom applications from the ground-up. I ultimately intend to
      start my own development shop.
