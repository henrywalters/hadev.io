    <p class="secondary-font">
      <a href="/">Henrywalters.dev</a> was developed as a hub for my software engineering projects.
      The focus of the featured projects are primarily game, web and general tooling. Source code for all projects and utilities (including <a href="https://github.com/henrywalters/henrywalters.dev">this site</a>)
      can be found on my <a href="https://github.com/henrywalters">Github</a> account.

    <p class="secondary-font">My name is Henry Walters and I started my programming journey developing programs on my TI-84 when I should have
      been paying attention in math class. I moved on to pursue a degree in Mathematics.  Throughout my college career,
      I dabbled more and more in programming, developing projects on the side as well as tools to help in my studies.
      It eventually occurred to me that programming was my true passion, with a special focus on computationally difficult problems.

    <p class="secondary-font">I continue to work, full-time, as a software engineer at a IT company in Metro Detroit. I am in charge of
      working with clients across various business domains, such as <a href="https://bettermade.com/">Bettermade Snackfoods</a> and <a href="http://www.powertran.com/">Powertran Transformers</a>, to update their pre-existing software in addition to building custom applications from the ground-up.
      Examples of projects include an ERP system, case management software and a hardware-integrated plastic injection monitoring system.
      In quick response to the Covid-19 Pandemic, I was one of two lead developers for a <a href="https://covid19employeescreen.com/">Covid-19 Employee Screening App</a> to help companies, such as <a href="https://www.metmuseum.org/">The Met</a>, remain complient
      and keep their employees and customers safe.
